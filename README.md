## 📦 Features:

### ✅ 1. **Phishing Simulation Module**

* Demonstrates phishing website cloning
* Educates users on phishing recognition
* Logs user inputs for analysis (non-malicious)

### ✅ 2. **Brute Force Attack Simulator**

* Shows how credentials can be guessed
* Helps officers understand login endpoint vulnerabilities

### ✅ 3. **Malware Dropper Simulator**

* Simulates dropping and detection of a payload
* Raises awareness about USB, email attachments, and download traps

### ✅ 4. **Logging Utility**

* All actions logged to help officers analyze patterns

### ✅ 5. **Report Generator**

* Officers can fill and export a report after simulation
* Markdown-based, can be extended to PDF

---

## 👮‍♂️ Use Case for Law Enforcement:

* **Cyber Crime Training:** Officers can use the toolkit during training to experience simulations.
* **Awareness Campaigns:** Used in schools/colleges by police for cybersecurity awareness.
* **In-House Drills:** Simulate an attack to measure response time or incident response readiness.

---

## 🚀 How to Run:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
